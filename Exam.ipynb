    "\n",
    "#### b) Build an array with the returns for each of these stocks. Find the mean daily returns for each stock and the variance-covariance of the returns using the .cov() method on returns. Create a portfolio that invests 40% (0.4), 50% (0.5), 10% (0.1) of the total investment in Amazon, Apple and Ford, respectively. Find the return and the standard deviation of return of this porfolio. (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio return is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "port_return = np.sum(mean_daily_returns * weights) * N\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the standard deviation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "port_std = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T,np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))) * np.sqrt(N)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Simulate 1000 protfolio returns by drawing random weights from random.rand. Weights must sum up to 1, hence draw two weights randomly and define the third weight as $w_3 = 1-w_1-w_2$. Do a scatter plot of the simulated portfolio returns on the y-axis with the simulted portfolio returns standard deviation on the x-axis. (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) Suppose you want to maximize a portfolio given the following objective function: $\\max_w R - std^2$ where $R$ is the portfolio return and $std$ is the portfolio return standard deviation and $w$ are the stock weights. Hence, this function reflects the trade-off between return and risk. Define the objective function. Then, minimize the negative of that function in order to find the optimal weights. Inside the objective function make sure that you define $w[2]= 1 - w[0]-w[1]$. When you get the final solution, it wont sum up to one. Hence, normalize it in order to find the optimal fraction of investment in each stock. (10 pts)\n",

Note that you will lose the first observation of the data. In the end, you should have three data sets with current price and future price as columns. (5 pts)\n",
